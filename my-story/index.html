                        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                            In a world full of beautiful places, colours, and people, I see things in black and white. Living with Asperger's, things are either right or wrong. No middle ground. I don't connect with small talk or sugar-coated answers. I care about what's real.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                            Growing up in a small town in Ontario, I didnt have many friends. I found strength in sports and volleyball became my outlet. Representing Team Ontario and Team Canada taught me discipline and determination. But behind the medals was a kid battling self-doubt and mental health struggles.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
                            Music helped me through a ton during those difficult times, it was my way of releasing what I needed. When words weren't enough, melodies, rhythms and good music became the language for emotions I couldn't otherwise express.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                            At my lowest point, I turned to cannabis to numb the pain. Human to human, don’t turn to drugs looking for answers. They don’t just hurt you, they hurt the people who care for you. My hardest moment through it all was realizing how deeply I hurt my parents. And yet, no matter what, they still love their son. I can never repay them for that, I can only try to be the best version of myself every day.
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
                            What I’ve come to understand is that real peace doesn’t come from running. It doesn’t come from avoiding the problem, it comes from facing it. It comes from being brutally honest with yourself, pushing through the discomfort, and doing the work to grow. All of this lead me here, truthfully grateful it happened, it gave me an opportunity to learn and grow as a person, and closer with my loved one. 
                        </p>

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4 text-center slide-in">My Advice</h2>
            
            <div class="glass-card p-8 md:p-10 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
                <p class="mb-6">There's no shortcut, the only way out is through. Growth hurts and change is uncomfortable. But that's where strength comes from. That's how self-respect is built.</p>
 
                <p class="mb-6">I had to stop chasing an escape and start building a life I didn't need to run from. I've learned that the grass isn't greener on the other side, it's greener where you water it. That means showing up every single day, even when it feels hard. Especially when it's hard. Because those moments, the ones you want to run from, that's where growth sprouts from. A seed must be buried in dirt but from that, the most beautiful flowers are grown.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">One of my favourite quotes says, "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger." Most people know it from Kelly Clarkson, but the words go back to 1888, written by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. It's more than a quote to me, it's the truth.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">Life will test you. It will break you down. But if you keep showing up, keep pushing through and don't aim to be invincible but rather unstoppable. You will become unstoppable.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">I stopped seeing life as a series of problems and started seeing it as a series of challenges with solutions. That shift changed everything. Once you realize you have control over how you respond, you stop waiting for better circumstances and start building better ones. No more waiting for the grass to be greener, start watering it.</p>
                
                <p class="mb-6">From the outside, it might have looked like I had it all. A top-level athlete playing for Team Ontario and Team Canada. A driven student, a guy with big goals. But behind the medals and jerseys was a kid battling self doubt every day. People said I was winning, but they didn't see the nights I went home and looked in the mirror, thinking I wasn't enough. Here's the truth: it doesn't matter how many people tell you you're doing great. If you don't believe it yourself, it doesn't mean anything. </p>
                
                <p>Why do I tell you all this, to show were all human, we make mistakes. That no matter how successful, poor, happy or sad. We all experience triumphs and often never know who silently struggles too. Be kind, enjoy the ones around you and it’s okay to be vulnerable, this is my way of doing so.</p>
